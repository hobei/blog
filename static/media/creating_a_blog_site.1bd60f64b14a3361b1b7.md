$title: Creating a blog site
$abstract: I wanted to write some blog posts, so first I had to create a blogging platform
$date: 22 December 2021

So it was the Christmas break and I wanted to create some blog posts about the
advent of code challenge I was doing. I looked at some of the  blogging sites, but did not want to sign up for a monthly subscription and did not want to have ads on my site, 
and so thought how hard can it be to create my own small blogging website using github pages.

I wanted to be able to create posts in markdown for simplicity. After a couple of hours this is the result. A very 
basic blogging site.
